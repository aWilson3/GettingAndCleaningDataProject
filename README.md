# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This goal of this project was to transform a given dataset into a specific format. The data used for the assignment was gathered from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data was obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

This Repo includes an R script containing all of the necessary steps to go from the given dataset to our final, "tidy" dataset. A codebook is also included, describing the variables/data.

A short overview of what the R script accomplishes is as follows: 
* Merge the training and testing sets
* Filter the dataset on certain variables (see codebook for more explenation)
* Add appropriate variables, with corresponding labels, to the dataset (see codebook for  more explenation)
* Write the new dataset to a text file
